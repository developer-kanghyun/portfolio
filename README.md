# Portfolio Project

This is a portfolio project built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Overview

This project showcases a collection of projects and skills. It is a single-page application that uses React for the user interface, TypeScript for type safety, and Vite for the build tool.

## Tech Stack

* **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
* **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides a quicker and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
* **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
* **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter.
* **Styled-components**: A library for styling React components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd portpolio
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open the application in your default browser.

### Build

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the production-ready files.

### Lint

To lint the code, run the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This will check the code for any linting errors.

### Preview

To preview the production build, run the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will start a local server to preview the production build.
